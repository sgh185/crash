Pitfalls/shortcomings from the first iteration:
- Class time too short --- not enough material covered
- Need a more motivational and exciting example set
  for the first day
- Need to cover more useful UNIX utilities (find, sed, etc.)
- Need more slides-based material for vim
- "Dummy" library should be replaced with code that
  may end up being useful to the student
- Workshop should end with an artifact for the student 
  (see below)


Future planning:
- High school deployment, possible partnerships with 
  Northwestern Academy, OCEP, etc.
- Expand to 7 days --- Day 6, 7 in the works


Future material:
- Profilers and tracing (gprof, l/strace, callgrind)
- Debugging and development strategies (bisection,
  preventative programming (i.e. assertions, etc.), 
  test-based development,  
- Project configuration setups (autoconf, etc.)
- Final artifact: Students build a profiler to track the 
  distribution of dynamic memory allocations (cover intro to
  dynamic memory). Students will build the profiler using C
  (using some starter code, will cover linker tricks, LD_PRELOAD,
  etc.) and incorporate some of the concepts from the workshop 
  to create a distributable package/source.
