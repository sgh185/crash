These examples expand on the following:
- ./broken expands on better project structure and a 
  more powerful makefile --- but it's broken when 
  compiling and running and test program 'myprog'
- ./correct has the fixed library code so that the 
  test program compiles and behaves correct, used to
  demonstrate debugging with gdb. ./correct/src/test.c 
  also commented out dummy code to demonstrate valgrind
